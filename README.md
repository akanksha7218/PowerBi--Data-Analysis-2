# ❤️ Heart Disease Indicators Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

This project is an **end-to-end Power BI Dashboard** that analyzes **key indicators related to heart diseases**.  
The goal of this project is to provide **healthcare professionals and researchers** with actionable insights on how **lifestyle choices and chronic conditions** correlate with the risk of heart diseases.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This dashboard uses health survey data to analyze **risk factors** such as:  
- Smoking status  
- Alcohol consumption  
- Diabetes prevalence  
- Kidney disease occurrence  
- Age and gender distribution  
- State-wise health variations  

By using **interactive visualizations**, this dashboard helps in identifying **high-risk groups**, **regional health patterns**, and **demographic insights**.

## 🔑 Key Metrics & KPIs
- **Total Alcohol Drinkers** → `445.13K`  
- **Smoker Distribution** → Current, Former, Never  
- **Diabetes Count by State**  
- **Kidney Disease Count by State**  
- **Alcohol Consumption by Gender**  
- **Age Category Distribution across States**  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
1. **Smoker Status Analysis**  
   - Breakdown of *never smokers*, *former smokers*, and *current smokers* by gender.  
   - Helps in understanding how lifestyle impacts heart health.  

2. **Alcohol Consumption Insights**  
   - **By Age Category** → Highest among *60–69 years old*.  
   - **By Gender** → Slightly higher among females (52.99%) than males (47.01%).  

3. **Diabetes Prevalence**  
   - State-level distribution showing hotspots like *Washington, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas*.  

4. **Kidney Disease Analysis**  
   - Visualized through a treemap showing states with the highest kidney disease patients (*Washington, New York, Ohio, Minnesota, Maryland*).  

5. **Demographic Distribution**  
   - Age categories from **18 to 80+** compared across states.  
   - Balanced representation ensures fair analysis of age-related risk factors.

## 🎯 Insights & Findings
- **Older adults (60–69 years)** show the highest rate of alcohol consumption.  
- **Females consume more alcohol** compared to males, which may impact risk trends.  
- **State-level disparities** highlight where chronic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease are most common.  
- **Never smokers** form the largest group, but current smokers remain a key risk group for heart-related conditions.
